= Spectura

Spectura is a microservice for taking screenshots of websites in an Open Graph
compatible format usable for link previews on sites such as Facebook and
LinkedIn.

Spectura takes a `url` and an optional signature `s` as query parameters. The
signature ensures that we only visit pre-approved URLs.

In local testing, `USE_SIGNATURES` is set to false, so you dont need the `s` parameter.

Spectura also takes `expire`. This is so that we don't spend time generating screenshots of expired jobs.
Expire is a unix timestamp in seconds. We return the fallback image if expire is exceeded.

If there is no present `expire` property, we always return the fallback image. This is for backwards compatability reasons.

== Setup

You either need to run a Decap instance manually, or run everything inside
Docker as described xref:run_docker[below].

To run Spectura in Docker, you need Docker version 20.10 or higher.

== Running

=== Basic usage

Assuming that Decap is listening on `localhost:4531`:

[source,shell]
----
go build
USE_SIGNATURES=false ./spectura
----

Then make a GET request on the same host:

[source,shell]
----
curl 'http://localhost:19165/api/spectura/v0/screenshot?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jobindex.dk%2F%3Fspectura%3D1&expire=2000000000' --output screenshot.png
----

=== Inside Docker [[run_docker]]

To run Spectura

[NOTE]
Always run with `--build`

[source,shell]
----
docker compose up --build
----

To test Spectura with `curl`

> Remeber you need to set `&expire=2000000000` or some other time after today. If you don't have expire or expire is earlier than today, you will get the fallback image.

[source,shell]
----
curl 'http://localhost:19165/api/spectura/v0/screenshot?url=https://pyjam.as&expire=2000000000'
----

If you use kitty terminal you can print the image directly in your terminal
[source,shell]
----
curl 'http://localhost:19165/api/spectura/v0/screenshot?url=https://pyjam.as&expire=2000000000' | kitty +kitten icat
----


=== Webhook

To get webhook updates you can set the `WEBHOOK_URL` and the `WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER`.

The `WEBHOOK_URL` will receive a `POST` request with the `Authorization` header set to the value in `WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER` and a JSON body looking like this:

----
{
  "EventType": "image_created",
  "URL": "https://pyjam.as",
  "ImageCreated": 1675773692,
  "Expire": 2000000000
}
----

Timestamps are represented as a UNIX seconds in UTC.

Event types contain the same data and are:

* `image_created`,  sent whenever and entry is created
* `image_updated`, sent whenever the image itself of a cache entry is updated.
